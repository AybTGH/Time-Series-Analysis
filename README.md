## Introduction to Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis involves studying data points collected, observed, or recorded at specific time intervals. This field is crucial for understanding trends, patterns, and behaviors inherent in time-dependent data. Time series analysis is extensively utilized in various domains, including finance, economics, signal processing, weather forecasting, and more.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Time Series
- Time Series Decomposition
- Stationarity and Differencing
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Modeling
- Exponential Smoothing Methods
- Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL)
- Prophet Forecasting Model
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks for Time Series Forecasting
- And more!

Each technique is accompanied by explanatory notes, code examples, and practical applications to enhance your understanding and proficiency in time series analysis.
